HOW TO CONFIGURE YOUR 3SCALE API PROXY
======================================

This Amazon instance contains an Nginx OpenResty installation. It is ready to be used as an
API proxy with 3scale, you only need to go into your 3scale account to get the Nginx config
files and drop them in the corresponding directory (see below).


If you don't have a 3scale account yet, you can get one now for free at:
  http://www.3scale.net/

If you have a 3scale account and you have already set up your API there, you can
download your config files from here. Run in the command line:
  > download-3scale-config

Your account info will be saved locally to ~/.config.json for future use. You can modify it at
anytime by invoking:
  > download-3scale-config --reset


By default the Nginx proxy is prepared to listen for incoming requests at port 80, but you can
change that by editing your Nginx config and the security group of this instance.
